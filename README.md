# LeglessLizard

## What is LeglessLizard?

A [legless lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legless_lizard) isn't a snake but it sure can look like one!

LeglessLizard (LGLZ) is my attempt at creating an interpreter in C
for a Python-based language. LeglessLizard is not a serious language
and contains many good-natured jabs at Python.
